# langres Examples

Example scripts demonstrating how to use the langres library, split into two
tiers:

- **Start here** — a clean progression for newcomers, top-level in `examples/`.
- **Research & benchmark reproductions** (`examples/research/`) — the
  milestone/benchmark/internal scripts used to validate the POC and later
  milestones. Not part of the newcomer path; kept for reproducibility.

## Setup

```bash
# Copy the example file and add any API keys you plan to use
cp .env.example .env
```

All environment variables are optional — most examples below run at **$0**
with no key required. Scripts that spend money say so explicitly in their
docstring and are gated behind an explicit flag or a hard budget cap.

## Start here

Run in this order for the intended newcomer progression — verbs quickstart →
dedupe → resolver → incremental assign → golden record → signal log →
flywheel harvest → closed-loop flywheel → person:

- **`quickstart_verbs.py`** — dedupe records with zero labels in a handful of
  lines, offline and $0 by default (`langres.dedupe`'s zero-spend string judge).
- **`basic_usage.py`** — the foundational data contracts (`CompanySchema`,
  `ERCandidate`, `PairwiseJudgement`).
- **`deduplication_example.py`** — end-to-end entity resolution on a
  real-world dataset of Swiss funder organization names.
- **`resolver_company_dedup.py`** — the `Resolver` north-star: company
  deduplication with `save`/`load`.
- **`incremental_assign.py`** — `AnchorStore` for incremental single-record
  assignment: "does this new record belong to an existing entity, or is it new?"
- **`canonicalizer_enrichment.py`** — the enrichment loop: a sparse mention
  links to an entity and enriches its golden record ($0, deterministic).
- **`judgement_log_demo.py`** — the flywheel inlet: log every judge call
  (`log=` on `dedupe()`/`link()`), then read the log back.
- **`flywheel_threshold_harvest.py`** — the flywheel outlet: logged verdicts +
  human corrections feed `derive_threshold` to re-calibrate a decision threshold.
- **`flywheel_closed_loop.py`** — the whole loop closed end to end at **$0**:
  bootstrap → select_for_review → harvest → train a cheap RandomForestMatcher student →
  `CascadeMatcher` (cheap everywhere, escalate only the margin) → report. The
  runnable twin of [`docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`](../docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)
  (needs the `[trained]` extra).
- **`person_resolution.py`** — the embeddings + LLM "strong path" on a second
  entity type: semantic blocking (MiniLM + FAISS) feeding an LLM judge.
- **`finetune_capstone.py`** — the training-surface capstone: **train your own
  matcher** end to end — fine-tune SmolLM2-135M with LoRA on a real benchmark
  slice, serve the weightless `model_ref` in-process, and evaluate held-out F1,
  reporting the honest cost in GPU-seconds. A REAL (small) fine-tune, slow on
  CPU/MPS; needs the `[finetune,semantic,llm]` extras (see its docstring).

## Example Data

The `data/` directory contains sample datasets used by the examples above and
by several research scripts:
- `companies.json` / `companies_labels.json` — funder organization names + ground truth
- `funder_names_with_ids.json` / `funder_name_deduplicated_groups.json` — labeled funder dedup data
- `flywheel/` — fixtures for the judgement-log harvest demo

## Research & benchmark reproductions (`examples/research/`)

Milestone exit-criteria runs, benchmark harnesses, and exploratory demos.
Several spend real money (OpenRouter) under an explicit hard budget cap — read
each script's docstring before running it. Companion `*_results*.json` /
`*_output.md` files are committed snapshots of past runs.

  on Fodors-Zagat, deterministic and free.

  cross-source band with a real budget-capped GLM teacher.

  Fodors-Zagat, zero spend.

## Troubleshooting

If you see errors like "environment variable is required":
1. Make sure you've created a `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`).
2. Add the required API keys for the services you're using (Azure/OpenRouter/wandb/Langfuse).
3. Most examples in **Start here** need no keys at all — if one fails on a
   missing key, you likely picked a script from `examples/research/` that needs one.
