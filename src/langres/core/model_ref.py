""":class:`ModelRef`: the ONE backbone concept — what fills a model slot.

An *architecture* is a topology (which components, in what order). A **backbone**
is what fills one of its model slots, and a :class:`ModelRef` is how langres
names one. Swapping a backbone must never mint a new architecture, so a
``ModelRef`` is **weightless by construction**: a few reference *strings*, never
weight bytes, so it round-trips through ``Resolver.save`` / ``load`` as plain
JSON config (:func:`to_config`). The weights are loaded lazily by the backend on
first use.

This module is deliberately import-light (stdlib only — no torch / transformers
/ litellm) so a bare ``import langres`` and the matchers' own imports stay
heavy-dependency free. It imports nothing from ``langres`` and must stay that
way: it is the leaf every model-bearing component depends on.

The ``kind`` discriminator
--------------------------
``kind`` names the *form* of the reference, and it is the **sole input to
routing**. Four forms:

===========  ==========================================  ==================
``kind``     what ``base`` names                         runs
===========  ==========================================  ==================
``api``      a litellm model id (``"openai/gpt-4o"``,    served (litellm)
             ``"gpt-5-mini"``)
``endpoint`` a model served at :attr:`ModelRef.api_base` served (litellm)
             (vLLM / Ollama / any OpenAI-compatible)
``hf``       a Hugging Face Hub id (``"org/name"``)      in-process
``local``    a local directory path                      in-process
===========  ==========================================  ==================

**Routing is a pure function of ``kind`` — never of the filesystem or the
current working directory** (B17). The predecessor of this module probed
``os.path.isdir(ref.base)`` on a *relative* path to decide, which meant a local
``./openai`` directory silently flipped routing litellm -> transformers: the
same saved config resolved to a different backend in a different working
directory. ``kind`` is carried in the config, so a saved artifact resolves
identically anywhere. :func:`backend_for` is the whole routing rule.

Why there is no "did you mean?" on an ``org/name`` typo
------------------------------------------------------
It is tempting to catch ``"opeani/gpt-4o"`` (a typo for the ``openai/``
provider) at construction by fuzzy-matching the org segment against the known
provider list. **This is not safely implementable, and the numbers say so.**
Measured with ``difflib.SequenceMatcher`` against :data:`_API_MODEL_PREFIXES`:

=========================  =========  =======
org segment                closest    ratio
=========================  =========  =======
``opeani``   (a typo)      openai     0.833
``openia``   (a typo)      openai     0.833
``mistralai`` (**REAL**)   mistral    **0.875**
``deepseek-ai`` (**REAL**) deepseek   **0.842**
=========================  =========  =======

The real HF orgs score *higher* than the typos. Any cutoff that catches
``opeani`` also rejects ``mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1`` — a wrong answer that
breaks working code, traded for a right answer on a typo that merely 404s. The
ranges overlap, so no threshold exists. ``org/name`` is genuinely ambiguous
between "HF Hub id" and "typo'd provider" and cannot be disambiguated by syntax.

So the escape hatch is the discriminator itself, not a guess: a caller who means
an API model says so (``{"base": "opeani/gpt-4o", "kind": "api"}``) and gets a
litellm error naming the provider. A did-you-mean belongs where a false positive
is *free* — in the failure message of a backend that already failed — never in
the routing decision that precedes it.

#: closeable: measured against the installed litellm, ``litellm.provider_list``
#: carries **146** providers while :data:`_API_MODEL_PREFIXES` carries **26** — so
#: **120** real provider ids (``ai21/...``, ``nvidia_nim/...``, ``voyage/...``)

#: reject working code, and the leaf cannot consult ``litellm.provider_list`` to

#: **The stricter alternative, recorded so it is cheap to flip:** drop ``"hf"``
#: from this set and DSPy-backed slots become API/endpoint-only, forcing every

    existing saved artifacts and their round-trips are unchanged, while any ref
    that inference could not reproduce widens to an explicit dict.
